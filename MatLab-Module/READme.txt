The task involves presenting a continuous series of stimuli, where each stimulus replaces the previous stimulus. The
stimuli might be letters of the alphabet, and an example sequence (presented one after the other) might be G C P Q
B C D Q . . . For each stimulus, the participant has to indicate whether the current stimulus is the same as the
stimulus presented N stimuli previously. For example, for the 4-back version of the task, the subject has to indicate
if the current stimulus is the same as the stimulus presented 4 stimuli previous to this one. For the sequence above,
and the 4-back version of the task, the stimuli and correct answers are:
• G - no (no stimulus 4 previous)
• C - no (no stimulus 4 previous)
• P - no (no stimulus 4 previous)
• Q - no (no stimulus 4 previous)
• B - no (stimulus 4 previous is G)
• C - yes (stimulus 4 previous is C)
• D - no (stimulus 4 previous is P)
• Q - yes (stimulus 4 previous is Q)
The aim of the structured programming exercise is to:
1. Implement the N-back task.
2. Run the task on three subjects and collect behavioral data.
3. Analyze and plot the data.
